              Drugs need to be tested, to avoid unwanted side effects. We need
              to make sure the drug doesn’t cause any other unwanted problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              They need to be tested and trialled before doctors prescribe them
              and patients take them. Drugs checked for:

            <h1>Safety</h1>
            <p>
              This is important as some drugs are toxic, and have other side
              effects that might be harmful to people.
            </p>
            <h1>Effectiveness</h1>
            <p>
              This is also known as efficacy, and checks how well the drug cures
              the disease, or improves symptoms.
            </p>
            <h1>Dogage</h1>
            <p>
              This varies, and has to be closely controlled, as too high a
              concentration might be toxic.

            The first step is always discorvery. When a new pathogen comes
            around doctors and labs collect samples of the pathogen from people
            who were affected. They will them look at how it spreads and what
            part of the body it affects
          </p>
          <p>
            For us, we got a group of people in chairs and watched their brain
            activity as they got more bored.
          </p>
          <h1>Research</h1>
          <p>
            During pre-clinical research there are two types of tests. In vitro
            and In vivo. In vitro is a test for effects on cells in a test tube.
            In vivo is testing the effect on cells within an organism. During
            Pre-Clinical research drugs are also trested using computer models.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clinical research is medical research involving people. There are
            two types, observational studies and clinical trials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Observational studies observe people in normal conditions.
            Researchers gather information, about changes over time and
            cognitive health. This is done though tests and questionnaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            In clinical research, drugs that passed pre-clinical trials are
            tested on animals. We will then monitor the organism. If they pass
            the drugs are tested in a hospital in healthy volunteers; from where
            we start to work out a suitable dose. We start on a low dosage and
            progess upwards. This is a human clinical trial.

        <h1>Stages of a clinical trial.</h1>
        <p>
          A Phase I trial tests an experimental treatment on a small group of
          often healthy people (20 to 80) to judge its safety and side effects
          and to find the correct drug dosage.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Phase II trial uses more people (100 to 300). The emphasis in Phase
          II is on effectiveness. It aims to obtain data on whether the drug
          works in people who have a certain disease or condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Phase III trial gathers more information about safety and
          effectiveness, studying different populations and different dosages,
          using the drug in combination with other drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Phase IV trial takes place after the FDA approves their use. The
          effectiveness and safety are monitored in large, diverse populations.
          Sometimes, the side effects of a drug may not become clear until more
          people have taken it over a longer period of time.
        </p>

      <section class="validation">
        <h1>Validation</h1>
        <p>
          All drugs that pass trials are sent to the FDA (Food and drug
          administration) and the NDA (New drug application) Drug review - the
          drugs are sent to be approved at other testing facilities like
          universities and other labs. Once approved the labels are created for
          the packaging and a suitable dose it added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally Post Marketing Drug Safety Monitoring takes place. The NDA
          approved drugs are sent to pharmacies, the scientists then closely
          monitor the effect on patients.
